## iOS

Apple is splitting iOS into two seperate operating systems; one for the iPhone which called iOS and a new one that running on the iPad called iPad OS. iOS 13 makes the Face ID unlock 30% faster than what it did; the lanuch speed of the APPs will doubled; at the same time, the volumes of APPs are half as much as before. In ad dition to the performance improvement, a new dark mode will be added which gives OS menus and APPs a dark background. On the privacy aspect, a new feature "Sign in with Apple" was announced to give users greater contorl over the data they share with APPs. With "Sign in with Apple", users can choose to share their real email address or send a automatically generated address that forwards to their email address if any APP ask the users to share their email address. Rely on the timeneuraltext-to-speech technology, Siri can transfer the text into the voice message then reply to the user; moreover, the tone of voice of Siri become more smoother.

## iPad OS

Comparing with the iOS 13, the changes for the new iPad OS is more attractive. The new iPad OS is a multitasking OS.  
If you would like to open an APP, just slide your finger from the side.
