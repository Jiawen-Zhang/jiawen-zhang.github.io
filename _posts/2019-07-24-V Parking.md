## What is V Parking

V Parking is aimed at marking parking smart in the University of Waterloo campus.

## Why I develop V Parking

The reason why I develop this app is that parking in the UW campus always troubles my girl, therefore, I made this app to help anyone who needs to park here.

## Functions of the Apps

**The app shows the real-time status of the four main parking lots by connecting to the UW open data API.**

In addition to these four parking lots, this app provides the information of Visitor, Meter, Short-term and Motorcycle parking lots. The information can be viewed on the map by tapping any lot which includes location, restriction, and price. You can record the location of your car and set a parking duration; V Parking will send notifications to you before time up.

Using the search bar to find the best-matched parking lots to your destination and navigate there; searching for free or daily parking is also available. If you encounter any problem with parking service, you can contact the UW Parking Services with one touch in the Info page.
